<p>The definition begins by asserting the existence of some bound \(M\).</p>
<p>The bound is a real number, meaning \(M \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>
<p>So the definition begins &ldquo;there exists an \(M \in \mathbb{R}\)&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bound must hold for all terms in the sequence.</p>
<p>So we will assert something for all indexes \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).</p>
<p>The definition begins &ldquo;there exists an \(M \in \mathbb{R}\), so that for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a particular term \(a_n\) to be bounded above by \(M\) just means that \(a_n \leq M\).</p>
<p>Altogether then, being bounded above means &ldquo;there exists an \(M \in \mathbb{R}\), so that for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), we have \(a_n \leq M\).&rdquo;  Sometimes you might see this ending with \( a_n < M \), but that is a difference which does not affect which sequences are bounded above.</p>
