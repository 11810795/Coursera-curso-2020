Armed with the ratio test and the integral test, it can be tempting to
apply them frequently.  But when faced with a new series
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$, what should we do?  First, consider $\lim_{n
  \to \infty} a_n$ and if that limit is nonzero, then by
Theorem~\xrefn{thm:nth-term-test} the series diverges.  If the series
passes that first test, then it is worth considering other tests like
the ratio test (perhaps if $a_n$ has factorials and powers) or the
integral test (if $a_n = f(n)$ and $\int f(x) \, dx$ is not too hard
to compute).

But the ratio test and integral test are not the only tools in our
toolbox.  The comparison test, which we discussed in
Section~\xrefn{section:comparison-test}, is extremely useful.

\begin{example}
  \label{example:reciprocal-n-squared-log-n}
  Does $\ds\sum_{n=2}^\infty {1\over n^2\log n}$ converge?
\end{example}

\marginnote{When I write $\log$, I mean the natural logarithm.  I
  prefer writing $\log n$ to writing $\ln n$.}

\begin{solution}
The obvious first approach, based on what we know, is the integral test.
Unfortunately, we can't compute the required antiderivative. But
looking at the series, it would appear that it must converge, because
the terms we are adding are smaller than the terms of a $p$-series,
that is,
$${1\over n^2\log n}<{1\over n^2},$$
when $n\ge3$. Since adding up the terms $\ds 1/n^2$ doesn't get ``too
big'', the new series ``should'' also converge. Let's make this more
precise.

The series $\ds\sum_{n=2}^\infty {1\over n^2\log n}$ converges if and
only if $\ds\sum_{n=3}^\infty {1\over n^2\log n}$ converges---all we've
done is dropped the initial term. We know that 
$\ds\sum_{n=3}^\infty {1\over n^2}$ converges. Looking at two typical
partial sums:
$$
  s_n={1\over 3^2\log 3}+{1\over 4^2\log 4}+{1\over 5^2\log 5}+\cdots+
  {1\over n^2\log n} < {1\over 3^2}+{1\over 4^2}+
  {1\over 5^2}+\cdots+{1\over n^2}=t_n.
$$
Since the $p$-series converges, say to $L$, and since the terms are positive,
$\ds t_n<L$. Since the terms of the new series are positive, the $\ds s_n$
form an increasing sequence and $\ds s_n<t_n<L$ for all $n$. Hence the
sequence $\ds \{s_n\}$ is bounded and so converges.
\end{solution}

Sometimes, even when the integral test applies, comparison to a known
series is easier, so it is a good idea to think about doing a
comparison before doing the integral test.

Like the integral test, the comparison test can be used to show both
convergence and divergence. In the case of the integral test, a single
calculation will confirm whichever is the case. To use the comparison
test we must first have a good idea as to convergence or divergence
and pick the sequence for comparison accordingly.

\begin{example} Does $\ds\sum_{n=2}^\infty {1\over\sqrt{n^2-3}}$ converge?
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
We observe that the $-3$ should have little effect compared to the
$\ds n^2$ inside the square root, and therefore guess that the terms are
enough like $\ds 1/\sqrt{n^2}=1/n$ that the series should diverge. We
attempt to show this by comparison to the harmonic series. We note
that 
$${1\over\sqrt{n^2-3}} > {1\over\sqrt{n^2}} = {1\over n},$$
so that
$$
  s_n={1\over\sqrt{2^2-3}}+{1\over\sqrt{3^2-3}}+\cdots+
  {1\over\sqrt{n^2-3}} > {1\over 2} + {1\over3}+\cdots+{1\over n}=t_n,
$$
where $\ds t_n$ is 1 less than the corresponding partial sum of the
harmonic series (because we start at $n=2$ instead of $n=1$). Since
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}t_n=\infty$, $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}s_n=\infty$ as
well.
\end{solution}

So the general approach is this: If you believe that a new series is
convergent, attempt to find a convergent series whose terms are larger
than the terms of the new series; if you believe that a new series is
divergent, attempt to find a divergent series whose terms are smaller
than the terms of the new series.  This is more of an art than a
science, which is part of what makes these sorts of problems so much
fun to do.

\begin{example} Does $\ds\sum_{n=1}^\infty {1\over\sqrt{n^2+3}}$ converge?
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
Just as in the last example, we guess that this is very much like the
harmonic series and so diverges. Unfortunately,
$${1\over\sqrt{n^2+3}} < {1\over n},$$
so we can't compare the series directly to the harmonic series.
A little thought leads us to
$${1\over\sqrt{n^2+3}} > {1\over\sqrt{n^2+3n^2}} = {1\over2n},$$ so if
$\sum 1/(2n)$ diverges then the given series diverges. But since $\sum
1/(2n)=(1/2)\sum 1/n$, theorem~\xrefn{thm:series are linear} implies
that it does indeed diverge.
\end{solution}
