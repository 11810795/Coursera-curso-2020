<p>Consider the sequence \(#{sequence}_{#{variable}}\).  Suppose you know that for all \(#{variable} > 1\), \[ #{bound_below} \leq #{sequence}_{#{variable}} \leq #{bound_above} \] and \(#{sequence}_{1} = #{latex(initial)}\), and \(#{sequence}_{2} = #{latex(next_term)}\), and that the sequence is #{direction_name}.  Does the sequence converge?</p>
