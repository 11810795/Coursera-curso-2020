<p>This is a geometric series.</p>
<p>Note that the common ratio between subsequent terms is \(r = #{latex(ratio)}\).</p>
<p condition="abs(ratio) < 1">Note that \(-1 &lt; r &lt; 1\).</p>
<p condition="abs(ratio) < 1">Consequently, the series converges.</p>
<p condition="abs(ratio) >= 1">Note that \(|r| \geq 1\).</p>
<p condition="abs(ratio) >= 1">Consequently, the series diverges.</p>
