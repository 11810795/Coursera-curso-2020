<p>It can be shown that \(\int_{#{initial}}^\infty #{latex(term_x)} \, dx = #{latex(integral_value)}\), which is the &ldquo;area&rdquo; under the graph of \(\displaystyle f(x) = #{latex(term_x)}\) and to the right of the line \(x = #{initial}\).  The value of \(\sum_{#{variable}=#{initial}}^\infty \left( #{latex(term)} \right)\) is in which of the following intervals?</p>
