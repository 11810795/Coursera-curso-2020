sequences-and-series
====================

These are course materials for my Sequences and Series course, which
is often the middle of a second semester calculus course.  This course
is an introduction to sequences, infinite series, convergence tests,
power series, and Taylor series.

* [textbook](https://github.com/kisonecat/sequences-and-series/tree/master/textbook) contains a textbook, based on [Guichard's calculus text](http://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus/)
* [branding](https://github.com/kisonecat/sequences-and-series/tree/master/branding) contains some images and text used to advertise the course on MOOC platforms.
