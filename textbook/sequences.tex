\section{Notation}

\nobreak A ``sequence'' of numbers is just a list of numbers.  For
example, here is a list of numbers:
$$
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \ldots
$$
Note that numbers in the list can repeat.  And consider those little
dots at the end!  The dots ``\ldots'' signify that the list keeps
going---forever.  Presumably the sequence continues by following the
pattern that the first few ``terms'' suggest.  But what's the pattern?  

To make this talk of ``patterns'' less ambiguous, it is useful to
think of a sequence as a function. We have up until now dealt with
functions whose domains are the real numbers, or a subset of the real
numbers, like $f(x)=\sin x$. A sequence is a function with domain the
natural numbers $\N=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ or the non-negative integers,
$\ds \Z^{\ge0}=\{0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$. The range of the function is still
allowed to be the real numbers; in symbols, we say that a sequence is
a function $f\colon \N\to\R$.

\marginnote{Maybe you are feeling that this formality is unnecessary,
  or even ridiculous; why can't we just list off a few terms and pick
  up on the pattern?  As we'll see later, that might be very hard to
  do!  There might be very different---but equally
  reasonable---patterns that start the same way.  To resolve this
  ambiguity, it is perhaps not so ridiculous to introduce the
  formalism of ``functions.''}

Sequences are written in a few different
ways, all equivalent; these all mean the same thing:
$$
  \displaylines{a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots \\
  \left\{a_n\right\}_{n=1}^\infty \\
  \left\{f(n)\right\}_{n=1}^\infty \\}
$$
We summarize the preceding discussion in the following definition.
\begin{definition} \relax\index{sequence} A \defnword{sequence}
  $(a_n)$ is, formally speaking, a real-valued function with domain
  the natural numbers $\N$ or the non-negative integers $\Z^{\ge 0}$.
  Stated more humbly, a sequence assigns a real number to whole
  numbers.

  The ``outputs'' of a sequence are the \defnword{terms} of the
  sequence; the ``$n^{\nth}$ term'' is the real number that the
  sequence associates to the natural number $n$, and is usually
  written $a_n$. \index{sequence!term}.
\end{definition} 

  \marginnote{Recall that the natural numbers $\N$ are the counting
    numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$.  If we want our sequence to start at
    zero, we use $\Z^{\ge 0}$ as the domain instead.}

  \marginnote{Some people---perhaps computer scientists?---might
    include zero in the natural numbers.}

\begin{warning}
  Our formal definition of sequence involves $\N$ and $\Z^{\ge 0}$.
  But depending on the context, it may be convenient for a sequence to
  start somewhere else---perhaps with some negative number.  We
  shouldn't let the formal definition get in the way of making the
  best choice for the problem at hand.
\end{warning}

\section{Defining sequences by giving a rule}

Just as with functions with domain the real numbers, we will most often
encounter sequences that can be expressed by a formula.  We have
already seen the sequence $\ds a_i=f(i)=1-1/2^i$, and others are easy
to come by:
\begin{align*}
  a_i &={i\over i+1} \\
  a_n &={1\over2^n} \\
  a_n &=\sin(n\pi/6) \\
  a_i &={(i-1)(i+2)\over2^i} \\
\end{align*}
Frequently these formulas will make sense if thought of either as
functions with domain $\R$ or $\N$, though occasionally the given
formula will make sense only for whole numbers.

\section{Defining sequences using previous terms}

\marginnote{You might be familiar with \textit{recursion} from, say, a
  computer science course.}

Another way to define a sequence is \textit{recursively}, that is, by
defining the later outputs in terms of previous outputs.  We start by
defining the first few terms of the sequence, and then describe how
later terms are computed in terms of previous terms.

\begin{example}
Define a sequence recursively by
$$
a_1 = 1, \quad a_2 = 3, \quad a_3 = 10,
$$
and the rule that $a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-3}$.  Compute $a_5$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  First we compute $a_4$.  Substituting $4$ for $n$ in the rule $a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-3}$, we find
$$
a_4 = a_{4-1} - a_{4-3} = a_3 - a_1.
$$
But we have values for $a_3$ and $a_1$, namely $10$ and $1$, respectively.  Therefore $a_4 = 10 - 1 = 9$.

Now we are in a position to compute $a_5$.  Substituting $5$ for $n$ in the rule $a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-3}$, we find
$$
a_5 = a_{5-1} - a_{5-3} = a_4 - a_2.
$$
We just computed $a_4 = 9$; we were given $a_2 = 3$.  Therefore $a_5 = 9 - 3 = 6$.
\end{solution}

\marginnote{You can imagine some very complicated sequences defined recursively.  Make up your own sequence and share it with your friends!}

\section{Examples}

\marginnote{Tons of entertaining sequences are listed in the \href{http://oeis.org/}{The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences}.}

Mathematics proceeds, in part, by finding precise statements for
everyday concepts.  We have already done this for sequences, by
providing a precise definition (``function from $\N$ to $\R$'') for
the everyday concept of ``list of real numbers.''  But all the
formalisms in the world aren't worth the paper they are printed on if
there aren't some interesting \textit{examples} of those precise
concepts.  Indeed, mathematics proceeds not only by generalizing and
formalizing, but by focusing on specific, concrete instances.  Let me
share some specific examples of sequences.

But before I share these examples, let me ask a fundamental question:
how can I hand you an example of a sequence? It is not enough just to
list off the first few terms.  Let's see why.

\begin{example}
Consider the sequence $(a_n)$
$$
a_1 = 41, \quad a_2 = 43, \quad a_3 = 47, \quad a_4 = 53, \ldots
$$
What is the next term $a_5$?
\end{example}

\marginnote{This particular polynomial $n^4 - n + 41$ is rather interesting, since it outputs many prime numbers.  You can read more at \href{http://oeis.org/A005846}{the OEIS}.}

\begin{solution}
In spite of many so-called ``intelligence tests'' asking questions like this, this question doesn't have an ``answer.''  Or worse, it has too many answers!

This sequence might be ``prime numbers starting at 41.''  In which case the next term is $a_5 =59$.  But maybe this sequence is given by the polynomial $a_n = n^2 - n + 41$.  In that case, $a_5 = 61$.  Who is to say which is the ``better'' answer?
\end{solution}

Now let's consider some families of sequences.

\subsection{Arithmetic sequences}

\begin{definition}
  An \defnword{arithmetic progression} (sometimes called an arithmetic
  sequence)\index{arithmetic progression} is a sequence where each
  term differs from the previous by the same, fixed quantity.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  An example of an arithmetic progression is the sequence
  $$
  a_1 = 10, \quad a_2 = 14, \quad a_3 = 18, \quad a_4 = 22, \ldots
  $$
  which is given by the rule $a_n = 6 + 4 \, n$.  Each term differs
  from the previous by four.
\end{example}

In general, an arithmetic progression in which subsequent terms differ
by $m$ can be written as
$$
a_n = m \, (n-1) + a_1.
$$
Alternatively, we could describe an arithmetic progression
recursively, by giving a starting value $a_1$, and using the rule that
$a_{n} = a_{n-1} + m$.

\subsection{Geometric sequences}

\begin{definition}
  A \defnword{geometric progression} (sometimes called an geometric
  sequence)\index{geometric progression} is a sequence where the ratio
  between subsequent terms if the same, fixed quantity.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  An example of an geometric progression is the sequence
  $$
  a_1 = 10, \quad a_2 = 30, \quad a_3 = 90, \quad a_4 = 270, \ldots
  $$
  which is given by the rule $a_n = 10 \cdot 3^n$.  Each term is three
  times the preceding term.
\end{example}

In general, a geometric progression in which the ratio between
subsequent terms is $r$ can be written as
$$
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}.
$$
Alternatively, we could describe a geometric progression
recursively, by giving a starting value $a_1$, and using the rule that
$a_{n} = r \cdot a_{n-1}$.

\subsection{Fibonacci numbers}

\marginnote{The Fibonacci numbers are interesting enough that a
  journal, \href{http://www.fq.math.ca/}{The Fibonacci Quaterly} is
  published four times yearly entirely on topics related to the
  Fibonacci numbers.}

The \defnword{Fibonacci numbers} are defined recursively, starting with
$$
F_0 = 0 \mbox{ and } F_1 = 1
$$
and the rule that $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.  In words, each term is
the sum of the previous two terms.  So the sequence of Fibonacci numbers starts
$$
0, \quad 1, \quad 1, \quad 2, \quad 3, \quad 5, \quad 8, \quad 13, \ldots
$$
and so on.

This is hardly the last time we will see the Fibonacci numbers.

\section{Limits}

Given a sequence, it is helpful to be able to say something
qualitative about the sequence; that is, we may want to address the
question such as ``what happens after a while?''  In other words,
faced with a sequence, we are interested in the limit
$$\lim_{i\to \infty} f(i) = \lim_{i\to\infty} a_i.$$
We already understand
$$\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$$
when $x$ is a variable taking on real values; now we simply want to
restrict the ``input'' values to be integers. No significant
difference is required in the definition of limit, except that we
specify, perhaps implicitly, that the variable is an integer.

\begin{definition} \relax\index{limit of a sequence}
Suppose that $\ds\left\{a_n\right\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence.
We say that $\ds \lim_{n\to \infty}a_n=L$ if for every $\epsilon>0$
there is an $N > 0$ so that whenever $n>N$, $|a_n-L|<\epsilon$. If
$\ds \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L$ we say that the sequence {\dfont
converges\index{convergent sequence}\index{sequence!convergent}\/},
otherwise it {\dfont diverges\index{divergent
sequence}\index{sequence!divergent}\/}.  
\end{definition} 

If $f(i)$ defines a sequence, and $f(x)$ makes sense, and 
$\ds \lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$, then it is clear that
$\ds \lim_{i\to\infty}f(i)=L$ as well, but it is important to note that
the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since
$\ds \lim_{x\to\infty}(1/x)=0$, it is clear that also
$\ds \lim_{i\to\infty}(1/i)=0$, that is, the numbers
$${1\over1},{1\over2},{1\over3},{1\over4},{1\over5},{1\over6},\ldots$$
get closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let 
$f(n)=\sin(n\pi)$. This is the sequence
$$
  \sin(0\pi), \sin(1\pi),\sin(2\pi),\sin(3\pi),\ldots=0,0,0,0,\ldots
$$
since $\sin(n\pi)=0$ when $n$ is an integer. Thus
$\ds \lim_{n\to\infty}f(n)=0$. But $\ds \lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$, when $x$ is
real, does not exist: as $x$ gets bigger and bigger, the values
$\sin(x\pi)$ do not get closer and closer to a single value, but take
on all values between $-1$ and $1$ over and over. In general, whenever
you want to know $\ds \lim_{n\to\infty}f(n)$ you should first attempt to
compute $\ds \lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$, since if the latter exists it is also
equal to the first limit. But if for some reason
$\ds \lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$ does not exist, it may still be true that 
$\ds \lim_{n\to\infty}f(n)$ exists, but you'll have to figure out
another way to compute it.

It is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since
the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a
sequence of dots. In figure~\xrefn{fig:graphs of sequences} we see the
graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real
functions.

Not surprisingly, the properties of limits of real functions translate
into properties of sequences quite easily. 

%\vbox{
\begin{theorem} \relax\label{thm:properties of sequences}
Suppose that $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L$ and 
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n=M$ and
$k$ is some constant. Then
\begin{align*}
&\lim_{n\to\infty} ka_n = k\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=kL \\
&\lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n+b_n) = \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n+\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n=L+M \\

  \lim_{n\to\infty}b_n}={L\over M},\hbox{ if $M$ is not 0} \\
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}
%}

Likewise, there is an analogue of the squeeze theorem for functions.

\begin{theorem}\relax\label{thm:squeeze theorem for sequences}
Suppose that $\ds a_n \le b_n \le c_n$ for all $n>N$, for some $N$.
If $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}c_n=L$, 
then $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n=L$.
\end{theorem}

And a final useful fact:

\begin{theorem} \relax\label{thm:absolute value sequence}
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}|a_n|=0$ if and only if
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=0$.
\end{theorem}

This says simply that the size of $\ds a_n$ gets close to zero if and
only if $\ds a_n$ gets close to zero.

\begin{example}
Determine whether $\ds\left\{{n\over n+1}\right\}_{n=0}^\infty$ converges or
diverges. If it converges, compute the limit.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
Since this makes sense for real numbers we consider
$$
\lim_{x\to\infty}{x\over x+1}=\lim_{x\to\infty}1-{1\over x+1}=1-0=1.
$$
Thus the sequence converges to 1.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
Determine whether $\ds\bigg\{{\ln n\over n}\bigg\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges or
diverges. If it converges, compute the limit.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}We compute
$$\lim_{x\to\infty}{\ln x\over x}=\lim_{x\to\infty}{1/x\over 1}=
0,$$
using L'H\^opital's Rule. 
Thus the sequence converges to 0.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
Determine whether $\ds\{(-1)^n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ converges or
diverges. If it converges, compute the limit. This does not make sense
for all real exponents, but the sequence is easy to understand: it is
$$1,-1,1,-1,1\ldots$$
and clearly diverges.
\end{example}
\label{example:alternating ones}

\begin{example}
Determine whether $\ds\{(-1/2)^n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ converges or
diverges. If it converges, compute the limit.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}We consider the sequence 
$\ds\{|(-1/2)^n|\}_{n=0}^\infty=\{(1/2)^n\}_{n=0}^\infty$.
Then
$$
  \lim_{x\to\infty}\left({1\over2}\right)^x=\lim_{x\to\infty}{1\over2^x}=0,
$$
so by theorem~\xrefn{thm:absolute value sequence} the sequence converges to 0.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
Determine whether $\ds\{(\sin n)/\sqrt{n}\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges or
diverges. If it converges, compute the limit. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
Since $|\sin n|\le 1$, $\ds 0\le|\sin n/\sqrt{n}|\le
1/\sqrt{n}$ and we can use theorem~\xrefn{thm:squeeze theorem for
sequences} with $\ds a_n=0$ and $\ds c_n=1/\sqrt{n}$. Since
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=\ds\lim_{n\to\infty} c_n=0$, 
$\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\sin n/\sqrt{n}=0$ and the sequence converges to 0.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
A particularly common and useful sequence is $\ds \{r^n\}_{n=0}^\infty$,
for various values of $r$.  For which values of $r$ does this sequence converge?
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
Some are quite easy to understand: If $r=1$
the sequence converges to 1 since every term is 1, and likewise if
$r=0$ the sequence converges to 0. If $r=-1$ this is
the sequence of example~\xrefn{example:alternating ones} and
diverges. If $r>1$ or $r<-1$ the terms $\ds r^n$ get large without limit,
so the sequence diverges. If $0<r<1$ then the sequence converges to
0. If $-1<r<0$ then $\ds |r^n|=|r|^n$ and $0<|r|<1$, so the sequence
$\ds \{|r|^n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ converges to 0, so also 
$\ds\{r^n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ converges to 0.
converges. In summary, $\ds \{r^n\}$ converges precisely when
$-1<r\le1$ in which case
$$
  \lim_{n\to\infty} r^n=\begin{cases}
  0& if $-1<r<1$ \\
  1& if $r=1$ \end{cases}
$$
\vskip-10pt\end{solution}

\section{Qualitative features of limits}

Sometimes we will not be able to determine the limit of a sequence,
but we still would like to know whether it converges. In some cases we
can determine this even without being able to compute the limit.

A sequence is called {\dfont increasing\index{sequence!increasing}\/}
or sometimes {\dfont strictly increasing\/} if $\ds a_i<a_{i+1}$ for all
$i$. It is called {\dfont
non-decreasing\index{sequence!non-decreasing}\/} or sometimes
(unfortunately) {\dfont increasing\/} if $\ds a_i\le a_{i+1}$ for all
$i$. Similarly a sequence is {\dfont
decreasing\index{sequence!decreasing}\/} if $\ds a_i>a_{i+1}$ for all $i$
and {\dfont non-increasing\index{sequence!non-increasing}\/} if
$\ds a_i\ge a_{i+1}$ for all $i$. If a sequence has any of these
properties it is called {\dfont monotonic\index{sequence!monotonic}\/}.

\begin{example}
The sequence
$$
  \left\{{2^i-1\over2^i}\right\}_{i=1}^\infty=
  {1\over2},{3\over4},{7\over8},{15\over16},\ldots,
$$
is increasing, and
$$ 
  \left\{{n+1\over n}\right\}_{i=1}^\infty=
  {2\over1},{3\over2},{4\over3},{5\over4},\ldots
$$
is decreasing.
\end{example}

A sequence is {\dfont bounded above\index{sequence!bounded above}\/}
if there is some number $N$ such that $\ds a_n\le N$ for every $n$,
and {\dfont bounded below\index{sequence!bounded below}\/} if there is
some number $N$ such that $\ds a_n\ge N$ for every $n$. If a sequence
is bounded above and bounded below it is {\dfont
bounded\index{sequence!bounded}\/}. If a sequence $\ds
\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is increasing or non-decreasing it is bounded
below (by $\ds a_0$), and if it is decreasing or non-increasing it is
bounded above (by $\ds a_0$).  Finally, with all this new terminology
we can state an important theorem.

\begin{theorem} If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it converges.
\end{theorem}

We will not prove this; the proof appears in many calculus books. It
is not hard to believe: suppose that a sequence is increasing and
bounded, so each term is larger than the one before, yet never larger
than some fixed value $N$. The terms must then get closer and closer
to some value between $\ds a_0$ and $N$. It need not be $N$, since $N$ may
be a ``too-generous'' upper bound; the limit will be the
smallest number that is above all of the terms $\ds a_i$.

\begin{example}
All of the terms $\ds (2^i-1)/2^i$ are less than 2, and the sequence is
increasing. As we have seen, the limit of the sequence is 1---1 is the
smallest number that is bigger than all the terms in the sequence.
Similarly, all of the terms $(n+1)/n$ are bigger than $1/2$, and the
limit is 1---1 is the largest number that is smaller than the terms of
the sequence.
\end{example}

We don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply
this theorem---it is enough to know that the sequence is
``eventually'' monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes
increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence $10$, $9$, $8$,
$15$, $3$, $21$, $4$, $3/4$, $7/8$, $15/16$, $31/32,\ldots$ is not
increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting
with the term $3/4$ it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the
sequence $3/4, 7/8, 15/16, 31/32,\ldots$ converges.  Since convergence
depends only on what happens as $n$ gets large, adding a few
terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a
divergent one.

\begin{example}
Show that $\ds\{n^{1/n}\}$ converges. 
\par\nobreak\ssk\noindent
We first show that 
this sequence is decreasing, that is, that $\ds n^{1/n}>
(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}$. Consider the real function $\ds f(x)=x^{1/x}$ when
$x\ge1$. We can compute the derivative, $\ds f'(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\ln x)/x^2$,
and note that when $x\ge 3$ this is negative. Since the function has
negative slope, $\ds n^{1/n}>
(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}$ when $n\ge 3$. Since all terms of the sequence are
positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when $n\ge3$, and so
the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in
this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see
exercise~\xrefn{exercise:exponential limit}.)
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Show that $\ds\{n!/n^n\}$ converges.
\par\nobreak\ssk\noindent
Again we show that the sequence is decreasing, and since each term is
positive the sequence converges. We can't take the derivative this
time, as $x!$ doesn't make sense for $x$ real. But we note that if 
$\ds a_{n+1}/a_n < 1$ then $\ds a_{n+1}< a_n$, which is what we want to
know. So we look at $\ds a_{n+1}/a_n$:
$$ 
  {a_{n+1}\over a_n} = {(n+1)!\over (n+1)^{n+1}}{n^n\over n!}=
  {(n+1)!\over n!}{n^n\over (n+1)^{n+1}}=
  {n+1\over n+1}\left({n\over n+1}\right)^n=
  \left({n\over n+1}\right)^n < 1.
$$
(Again it is possible to compute the limit; see
exercise~\xrefn{exercise:factorial limit}.)
