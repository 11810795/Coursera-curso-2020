Dear %NAME%,
<br>
<br>For me, a MOOC is more than teachingâ€”it is a way for me to <em>learn</em> what works in the classroom. For starters, I want to learn as much as I can about who is taking this course.
<br>
<br>I would very much appreciate your taking a short demographic survey, available at <a title="Link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5NPGQRR?c=%GLOBAL_USER_ID:2013-may-demographics%" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5NPGQRR?c=%GLOBAL_USER_ID:2013-may-demographics%">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5NPGQRR?c=%GLOBAL_USER_ID:2013-may-demographics%</a>
<br>
<br>You may already have taken this demographic survey from Coursera; if you have already completed the demographic survey, you do not need to take the survey again.
<br>
<br>Thanks for your help with this and everything in the course,
<br>~jim
