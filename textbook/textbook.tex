\chapter*{How to \sout{read} do mathematics}

Reading mathematics is \textbf{not} the same as reading a novel---it's
more fun, and more interactive!  To read mathematics you need
\begin{enumerate}
\item a pen,
\item plenty of blank paper, and
\item the courage to write down everything---even ``obvious'' things.
\end{enumerate}
As you read a math book, you work along with me, the author, trying to
anticipate my next thoughts, repeating many of the same calculations I
did to write this book.  You must \textbf{write} down each expression,
\textbf{sketch} each graph, and constantly \textbf{think} about what
you are doing.  You should work examples.  You should fill-in the
details I left out.  This is not an easy task; it is in fact
\textbf{hard} work, but, work that is, I very much hope, rewarding in
the end.

Mathematics is not a passive endeavor.  I may call you a ``reader''
but you are not reading---you are writing this book---no, I mean your
journey---for yourself.
