<p>Consider the polynomial \(p(x) = #{latex(the_polynomial)}\).  Use the Taylor series for \(#{latex(the_trig_function)}\) to find a Taylor series for \[f(x) = p(#{latex(the_trig_function)})\] around the point \(x = 0\).</p>
<p>Don't just calculate this by differentiating right away.  Instead, start with the first few terms of the Taylor series for \(#{latex(the_trig_function)}\), and substitute those into the given polynomial to figure out the first few terms.  Feel the power of Taylor series!</p>
