\chapter*{How to \sout{read} do mathematics}

Reading mathematics is \textbf{not} the same as reading a novel---it's
more fun, and more interactive!  To read mathematics you need
\begin{enumerate}
\item a pen,
\item plenty of blank paper, and
\item the courage to write down everything---even ``obvious'' things.
\end{enumerate}
As you read a math book, you work along with me, the author, trying to
anticipate my next thoughts, repeating many of the same calculations I
did to write this book.  You must \textbf{write} down each expression,
\textbf{sketch} each graph, and constantly \textbf{think} about what
you are doing.  You should work examples.  You should fill-in the
details I left out.  This is not an easy task; it is \textbf{hard}
work, but, work that is, I very much hope, rewarding in the end.

Mathematics is not a passive endeavor.  I may call you a ``reader''
but you are not reading; you are writing this book for yourself.

It is generally quite difficult---indeed, often impossible---to
determine the value of a series exactly.  Even if we can't compute the
value of a series, in many cases it is possible to determine whether
or not the series converges. We will spend most of our time on this
problem.

However, this chapter is yet to be revealed!  It will be revealed on
around 10:00am Eastern on October 11, 2013.  Stay tuned.
