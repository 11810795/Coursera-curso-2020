<p>Recall that the Taylor series for \(f\) around \(a\) is given by \[\sum_{n=0}^\infty {f^{(n)}(a)\over n!}(x-a)^n\].</p>
<p>In this case, we are told to consider \(a = #{latex(the_center)}\).</p>
<p>So we must calculate derivatives of \(f\) at \(#{latex(the_center)}\).</p>
<p>Start by calculating the zeroth derivative, meaning just the function itself, at \(x = #{latex(the_center)}\).</p>
<p>In that case, \(f(#{latex(the_center)}) = #{latex(the_function(x=the_center))}\).</p>
<p>Next calculate \(\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = #{latex(derivative(the_function,x))}\).</p>
<p>Therefore, \(f^{(1)}(#{latex(the_center)}) = #{latex(derivative(the_function,x)(x=the_center))}\).</p>
<p>Next calculate \(f^{(2)}(x) = \frac{d}{dx} #{latex(simplify(derivative(the_function,x)))} = #{latex(simplify(derivative(derivative(the_function,x),x)))}\).</p>
<p>Therefore \(f^{(2)}(#{latex(the_center)}) = #{latex(simplify(derivative(derivative(the_function,x),x))(x=the_center))}\).</p>
<p>This is enough to pick out the correct answer from among the given answers.</p>
<p>Consider the \(n = 2\) term, i.e., the coefficient on \(x^2\).  Since \(f^{(2)}(#{latex(the_center)}) = #{latex(simplify(derivative(derivative(the_function,x),x))(x=the_center))}\), the coefficient must be \(#{latex(simplify(derivative(derivative(the_function,x),x))(x=the_center)/2)}\).
</p>
<p>Looking over the possible answers, the power series for \(f\) must begin #{the_answer}.</p>
