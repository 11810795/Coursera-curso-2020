<p>It can be shown that \[L = \sum_{#{variable}=#{initial}}^\infty \left( #{latex(term)} \right) = #{latex(actual_value)},\] but since this is an alternating series, its value can be approximated.  By the alternating series test, which of the following is known to be an estimate of \(L\) to within an error of \(#{latex(goal_accuracy)}\)?  Once again, I imagine you may want to use a calculator to do some arithmetic, but using the &ldquo;ln&rdquo; button might spoil the fun.</p>
