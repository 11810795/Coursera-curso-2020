<p>Suppose \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) is a smooth, real-valued function, and suppose we know that \(f(#{latex(the_center)}) = #{latex(f_at_center)}\) and \(f'(#{latex(the_center)}) = #{latex(derivative_at_center)}\) and \(f^{(2)}(#{latex(the_center)}) = #{latex(second_derivative_at_center)}\).  Finally, suppose that for all \(x\), we have \(|f^{(3)}(x)| \leq #{latex(third_derivative_bound)}\).</p>
<p>In light of all this, what can you say about \(f(#{latex(the_point)})\)?</p>
