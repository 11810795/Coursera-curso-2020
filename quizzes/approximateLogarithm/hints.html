<p>We first look for a term in the series with absolute value no larger than \(#{latex(goal_accuracy)}\).</p>
<p>Set \(a_{#{variable}} = #{latex(term)}\).</p>
<p>Plugging in a few values, we find that when \(#{variable} = #{latex(need_terms+1)}\), then \(|a_{#{need_terms+1}}| = #{latex(abs(term_x(x=need_terms+1)))}\) which is less than \(#{latex(goal_accuracy)}\).</p>
<p>So the true value of the series is between \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{initial}}^{#{latex(need_terms)}} #{latex(term)}\) and \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{initial}}^{#{latex(need_terms+1)}} #{latex(term)}\).</p>
<p>Doing some arithmetic, \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{initial}}^{#{latex(need_terms)}} #{latex(term)} = #{latex(sum(term_x,var('x'),initial,need_terms))}\).</p>
<p>Doing some more arithmetic, \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{initial}}^{#{latex(need_terms+1)}} #{latex(term)} = #{latex(sum(term_x,var('x'),initial,need_terms+1))}\).</p>
<p>Looking over the possible choices, \(#{latex(rational_answer)}\) is between \(#{latex(sum(term_x,var('x'),initial,need_terms))}\) and \(#{latex(sum(term_x,var('x'),initial,need_terms+1))}\).</p>
<p>So we conclude that \(\left| L - #{latex(rational_answer)} \right| < #{latex(goal_accuracy)}\).</p>
<p>In other words, \(L\) is approximately \(#{latex(rational_answer)}\) with an error of no more than \(#{latex(goal_accuracy)}\).</p>
