<p>We are trying to make precise the idea that, by adding up sufficiently many of the terms of the sequence \(a_k\), we can get as close to \(L\) as desired.</p>
<p>We consider the sequence of partial sums, \((s_n)\).</p>
<p>For this course, the term \(s_n\) is the sum of the terms through index \(n\).  Be warned though some people might define it differently: in some texts, the term \(s_n\) may be the sum of the first \(n\) terms.</p>
<p>So \(s_n = \displaystyle\sum_{k=4}^n a_k\).</p>
<p>To say that we can get as close as desired to \(L\) by adding up many terms is to say that \(s_n\) is as close as desired to \(L\) whenever \(n\) is large enough.</p>
<p>This is saying that the sequence \(s_n\) converges to \(L\).</p>
<p>So to say that \(\displaystyle\sum_{k=4}^\infty a_k = L\) means that the sequence of partial sums \(s_n = \displaystyle\sum_{k=4}^n a_k \) converges to \(L\).</p>
