<p>Consider the sequence given by the rule \[#{sequence_name}_{#{variable}} = #{sequence_latex}.\]  For which value of \(#{str(variable).capitalize()}\) is it the case that whenever \(#{variable} \geq #{str(variable).capitalize()}\) we have that \(#{sequence_name}_{#{variable}}\) is within \(#{epsilon}\) of \(#{sequence_limit}\)?</p>
