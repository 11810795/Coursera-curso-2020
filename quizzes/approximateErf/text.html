<p>Consider the function \[f(t) = \int_0^t e^{-x^2} \, dx.\]  This is an an important function in probability, but it can be hard to work with because it isn't possible to write down an antiderivative for \(e^{-x^2}\) using the &ldquo;elementary&rdquo; functions we have on hand.  So if we want to compute \(f(#{latex(desired_point)})\), we'll have to do some work.  Put together what you know about \(e^x\), about integrating power series, and about approximating alternating series to evaluate \(f(#{latex(desired_point)})\) to within \(#{latex(goal_accuracy)}\).</p>
<p>I imagine you may want to use a calculator to do some arithmetic, but using the &ldquo;erf&rdquo; button might spoil the fun&mdash;assuming your calculator has one, and you rescale it appropriately.</p>
