<p>We are told that \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|\) converges, which means that the series is absolutely convergent.</p>
<p>Since \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|\) converges, so too does \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2|a_n|\).</p>
<p>But note that \(0 \leq a_n+|a_n| \leq 2|a_n|\).</p>
<p>Consequently, by the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( a_n + |a_n| \right)\) converges, since it has nonnegative terms and is smaller termwise than the convergent series \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2|a_n|\).</p>
<p>Consider \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_n+|a_n|) -\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|\).</p>
<p>This is a difference of convergent series.</p>
<p>So \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_n+|a_n|) -\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n| = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( a_n+|a_n|-|a_n| \right)\) converges.</p>
<p>But that is just to say that \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( a_n+|a_n|-|a_n| \right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \) converges.</p>
<p>So we conclude that the series \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \) converges.</p>
<p>This is usually stated as a theorem: absolute convergence implies convergence.</p>
