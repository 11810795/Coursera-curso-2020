<p>We are trying to make precise the idea that, eventually, all the terms of the sequence \(a_n\) are as close as we want to \(L\).</p>
<p>To measure closeness to \(L\), we will use a positive real number \(\epsilon\).</p>
<p>We must achieve any desired degree of closeness, so we will make a statement which is true for any positive real number \(\epsilon\).</p>
<p>In other words, the definition will begin &ldquo;For every positive real number \(\epsilon > 0\)&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now must make precise the idea of &ldquo;eventually&rdquo; close.</p>
<p>We use a whole number \(N\) to capture the idea of &ldquo;sufficiently large&rdquo; values of \(n\).</p>
<p>Specifically, the definition will begin &ldquo;For every positive real number \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an \(N \in \mathbb{N}\)&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;sufficiently large&rdquo; value of \(n\) is any value which is at least as large as \(N\).</p>
<p>So we will only consider those \(n\) for which \(n \geq N\).</p>
<p>Thus the definition goes &ldquo;For every positive real number \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists an \(N \in \mathbb{N}\) so that whenever \(n \geq N\)&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What happens &ldquo;eventually&rdquo; is that terms of the sequence are close to \(L\).  How close?  Within \(\epsilon\).</p>
<p>The quantity \(|a_n - L|\) is the distance between \(a_n\) and \(L\).</p>
<p>To say that \(a_n\) is within \(\epsilon\) of \(L\) is to say that \(|a_n - L| < \epsilon\).</p>
<p>Therefore the definition is &ldquo;For every positive real number \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists an \(N \in \mathbb{N}\) so that whenever \(n \geq N\), we have \( |a_n - L| < \epsilon \).&rdquo;</p>
