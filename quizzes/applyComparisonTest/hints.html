<p>The suggestion is to use the fact that \(#{latex(numerator_n)} \leq #{latex(2**variable)}\) whenever \(#{variable} \geq #{cutoff}\).</p>
<p>As a result, \(#{latex(term)} \leq #{latex(2**variable/(denominator_n))}\) whenever  \(#{variable} \geq #{cutoff}\).</p>
<p>This means that \(#{latex(term)} \leq #{latex((Rational(2,1)/ratio)**variable)}\) whenever  \(#{variable} \geq #{cutoff}\).</p>
<p>But the series \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{max(cutoff,initial)}}^\infty #{latex((Rational(2,1)/ratio)**variable)}\) is a geometric series.</p>
<p>And since the common ratio is between \(-1\) and \(1\), the series \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{max(cutoff,initial)}}^\infty #{latex((Rational(2,1)/ratio)**variable)}\) converges.</p>
<p>Additionally, all the terms in the series \(\sum_{#{variable}=#{initial}}^\infty \left( #{latex(term)} \right)\) are positive.</p>
<p>So the comparison test can be applied.</p>
<p>And by the comparison test, this means that \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{max(cutoff,initial)}}^\infty #{latex(term)}\) converges.</p>
<p condition="max(cutoff,initial) != initial">So the given series \(\sum_{#{variable} = #{initial}}^\infty #{latex(term)}\) converges, since convergence only depends on the tail of the series.</p>
