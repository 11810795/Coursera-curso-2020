<p>To be bounded, there should be some bound.  Let's call it \(M\).</p>
<p>\(M\) is a real number.  We can write that as \(M \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>
<p>We are considering a sequence \(a_n\).</p>
<p>To be bounded below, every single term in the sequence must be bigger than \(M\).</p>
<p>To be bounded below, for every single term \(a_n\) in the sequence, \(a_n > M\).</p>
<p>To be bounded below, for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), we have \(a_n > M\).</p>
<p>Putting it all together, "bounded below" means that there exists an , so that for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), we have \(a_n > M\).</p>
