<%= week_title( 2, "Series" ) %>

<p id="week-summary">In this second week, we introduce the second main topic of study: series.  We'll be focusing on series for the rest of the course, so if you find things confusing, there is a lot of time to catch up.</p>

<p>Last week, in <a href="/sequence-001/wiki/view?page=week1">Week 1</a>, we studied sequences; <%= linkto_video('week2-welcome','this week, we introduce series') %>.  Let me also warn you that <strong>the material this week will feel quite abstract.</strong>  If you ever feel lost this week, let me reassure you by pointing out that <a href="/sequence-001/wiki/view?page=week3">Week 3</a> will present additional concrete examples.</p>

<p>And starting this week, I will be holding <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1U-pjvjDeM"><i class="icon-film"></i>&nbsp;Office Hours for Calculus Two</a>.  I'll collect your questions and build an office hours video around them.  You can get questions to me by sending me an <a href="mailto:fowler@math.osu.edu"><i class="icon-envelope-alt"></i>&nbsp;email</a>, or by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/my_webcam"><i class="icon-facetime-video"></i>&nbsp;recording a video on YouTube and sending me a link</a>, or by <a href="https://class.coursera.org/sequence-001/forum/list?forum_id=10081"><i class="icon-comments"></i>&nbsp;posting in the Office Hours forum</a>.  I'm looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Finally, if you have any questions or concerns, I hope you will <a href="/sequence-001/forum/index"><i class="icon-comments"></i>&nbsp;post your comments and concerns in the forum</a>.</p>

<h4>What is a series?</h4>

<p>Intuitively, a &ldquo;series&rdquo; is what you get when you add up the terms of a sequence, in the order that they are presented.  A <%= linkto_video('series-definition','formal definition') %> can be found in <%= linkto_textbook('section:series-definition') %>.  Specifically, let's consider the series \(\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\).  To say this series converges to \(L\) means that the sequence of partial sums \(s_n = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^n a_k\) converges to \(L\), that is, \[\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k = \displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^n a_k.\]</p>

<p>To get a first taste of series, consider <%= linkto_video('sum-of-half-powers','the series \(\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty 1/2^k\)') %>.  This series converges to the value 2.</p>

<h4>What are some examples of series?</h4>

<h5>What is a geometric series?</h5>

<p>There are some specific sorts of series that will arise often in our discussions.  One popular families of series are the  <%= linkto_video('geometric-series','geometric series') %>, which you can read about in <%= linkto_textbook('section:geometric-series') %>.  To handle  <%= linkto_video('geometric-series-initial-n','more general geometric series') %>, you may want to apply <%= linkto_textbook('thm:distributive-over-series') %>.</p>

<h5>What is a telescoping series?</h5>

<p>Another popular family of series are the <%= linkto_video('telescoping-series','telescoping series') %>, which you can read about in <%= linkto_textbook('section:telescoping-series') %>.</p>

<h4>What about more complicated series?</h4>

<p>Geometric series and telescoping series are somewhat special, in that not only can we determine convergence, but we can also determine the <em>value</em> of the series&mdash;in those cases, we can actually find the limit of the sequence of partial sums.  In general, we are not so lucky, and we must content ourselves with being able to answer the basic question: does the series converge or diverge?</p>

<h4>How can I prove that some series diverge?</h4>

<p>One way to prove that a series diverges is to <%= linkto_video('nth-term-test','examine the limit of the terms') %>.  This method is discussed in more detail in <%= linkto_textbook('section:nth-term-test') %>, but the basic gist is that if \(\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0\), then the series \(\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\) diverges.</p>

<h4>What is the harmonic series?</h4>

<p>On the other hand, it is entirely possible for \(\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0\), and yet to have the series \(\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\) diverge.  The prototypical example of this phenomenon is the <%= linkto_video('harmonic-series','harmonic series') %>, which is \[\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}.\]  Note that \(\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0\) and yet, as we saw, the harmonic series diverges.</p>

<p>You can read more about the harmonic series in <%=linkto_textbook('section:harmonic-series')%>.</p>

<h4>What about more complicated series?</h4>

<p>So we have some tools to show that series diverge&mdash;what if we want to prove that series converges?  One method is to <%= linkto_video('comparison-test-example','compare a specific series with a well-known convergent series, like a geometric series') %>.  This method is formalized as the <%= linkto_video('comparison-test','comparison test') %>, and you can read more about it in <%= linkto_textbook('section:comparison-test') %>, specifically <%= linkto_textbook('thm:comparison-test') %>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of one such &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; series.  The <%= wikipedia('Basel_problem', 'Basel problem') %>, first posed in 1644, asks for the value of the series
\[
\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} + \cdots
\]
It wasn't until almost a century later that the value was determined by a rigorous argument.  We don't yet have the tools to determine the value, but we can show that <%= linkto_video('basel-problem','the series converges by a few different methods') %>, one of which is <%= linkto_video('cauchy-condensation','Cauchy condensation') %>.

<h4>What is point nine repeating?  What about numbers that &ldquo;go to the left&rdquo; instead of the right?</h4>

<p>It is the case that <%= wikipedia('0.999...', '\(0.\bar{9} = 0.999999\cdots = 1\)') %>, but that fact can be very counterintuitive.  We can use <%= linkto_video('point-nine-repeating','geometric series to convince ourselves of this fact') %>.</p>

<p>If we are thinking about \(0.999999\cdots\), we could also consider \(\cdots 999999\), by which I mean, we could consider \(\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty (9 \cdot 10^n)\).  This is nonsense since that series diverges, and yet <%= linkto_video('ten-adic-arithmetic','there is a sense in which it makes sense') %>!  In binary, such thinking is usually called <%= wikipedia('Two\'s_complement', 'two&#8217;s complement arithmetic') %>, but it is also related to the <%= wikipedia('P-adic_number', 'p-adic numbers') %>.  There are some general techniques to assign &ldquo;values&rdquo; to <%= wikipedia('Divergent_series', 'series that do not actually converge') %>.  It is certainly a fun topic to think about.</p>

<h4>By the end of the week&hellip;</h4>

<p>As usual, I have some learning objectives for you which you can practice by doing the homework.  At the end of this week, I hope you will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>define the <%= linkto_video('series-definition','value of a series') %>,</li>
<li>analyze the <%= linkto_video('geometric-series','convergence of a geometric series') %>,</li>
<li>evaluate a <%= linkto_video('geometric-series-initial-n','geometric series') %>,</li>
<li>evaluate a <%= linkto_video('telescoping-series','telescoping series') %>,</li>
<li>apply the  <%= linkto_video('nth-term-test','limit test for divergence') %>,</li>
<li>analyze a series similar to the  <%= linkto_video('harmonic-series','harmonic series') %>, and</li>
<li>apply the  <%= linkto_video('comparison-test','comparison test') %> to analyze convergence.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you feel ready, you can <a href="/sequence-001/quiz/attempt?quiz_id=75"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>&nbsp;work on the homework</a>.  The homework is &ldquo;formative assessment&rdquo; as opposed to summative assessment.  As such, the homework should be seen as a way to check your understanding.  Use the hints when you get stuck.  Discuss freely on the forums.  Do the homework again and again.  Feel free to use the provided resources in whatever way helps you to understand the material.  I want you to succeed, and, with practice, I know you will.</p>

<h4>But there is so much more!</h4>

<p>You are right!  There is a lot more to do, and many of the topics that we have touched on this week are <em>not</em> included on the list of learning objectives.  Many of these topics, like \(p\)-series, will be covered again in more detail during Week 3.  Stay tuned!</p>
